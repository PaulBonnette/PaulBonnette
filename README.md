Welcome to my <em>personal</em> GitHub repository.

I've been developing commercial applications for almost 30 years now.  I'm currently working on React/Jamstack and Laravel Full Stack applications, which are written in TypeScript and PHP 8.3+.  I've been developing PHP/LAMP applications for almost 20 years.  Before that I developed over half dozen Windows applications in the law enforcement and education.  My systems have processed over 10 million dollars in ecommerce and another half a <em>trillion</em> dollars in estimates and other commerce. Yes, I started back when the Internet was young but enjoy seeing the technological landscape evolve and improve over the years.
