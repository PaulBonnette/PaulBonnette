Welcome to my <em>personal</em> GitHub repository, where I share some of my most useful packages.

I've built PHP systems which have handled over 10 million dollars in ecommerce, with another half a trillion in estimates, etc.  

My experience includes years of TypeScript, React, Jamstack, DB2, RPGLE, IBM administration, Delphi, FoxPro, Access, and over 20 years of Linux administration.   

My current focus is using the Laravel framework to build front ends for servers such as the IBM iSeries.

Hope these packages are of some use to you.
