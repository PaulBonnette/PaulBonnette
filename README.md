Welcome to my GitHub repository.

I've been developing commercial applications for about 25 years.  I'm currently working on Full Stack applications due to their more robust nature.  I've been developing PHP/LAMP applications for almost 20 years and MERN/Jamstack applications for about a year and a half now.

To learn about some of my projects and career you can visit [My Blog](https://paulbonnette.app) for more information.  If you want to contact me please visit [Commercial Grade](https://commercialgrade.com/contact-us/) and I'll be happy to help you.
