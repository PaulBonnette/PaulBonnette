Welcome to my <em>personal</em> GitHub repository.

I've been developing commercial applications for almost 30 years now.  I'm currently working on React/Jamstack and Laravel Full Stack applications, which are written in TypeScript and PHP.  I've been developing PHP/LAMP applications for almost 20 years before that and about a dozen Windows applications and integrations in the Law Enforcement and educational fields before that.  My systems have processed over 10 million dollars in ecommerce and another half a <em>trillion</em> dollars in estimates and other commerce.   

To learn about some of my projects and career you can visit [My Blog](https://paulbonnette.app) for more information.  If you want to contact me please visit [Commercial Grade](https://commercialgrade.com/contact-us/).  I'll be happy to help you.
